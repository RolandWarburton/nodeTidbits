# Database stuff 
Using MongoDB, React, and Express.

### TODO:
Understand how the hell image and file uploads work. It seems almost impossible with axios so i think i need to write a new version without axios ðŸ˜’

### dotenv
The dotenv should contain something that looks like:
```
DB_CONNECTION=mongodb://<username>:<password>@139.180.169.10:27017/testdb
ROOT=/home/roland/Documents/Projects/musicSite
```

I dont have any good notes on setting up mongo at the moment unfortunately
