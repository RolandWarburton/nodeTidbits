#Node Tidbits
Simple node projects for reference and learning for building node applications.

you can install node packages with
```npm install```

you can build babel stuff (located in /src) with the command located in the package.json
```babel src -d lib```

you can run most node projects with ```node --experimental-modules main.js``` (if its not babel, which doesnt use experimental modules) or whatever else is inside the package.json.
